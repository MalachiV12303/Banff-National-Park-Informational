			reserve of 26 square kilometers around the hot springs at Cave and
			Basin as a public park known as theÂ Banff Hot Springs Reserve

		<p>
			under the Rocky Mountain Parks Act, the park was expanded to 674 km2
			(260 sq mi) and named Rocky Mountains Park
		</p>
		<p>by 1911, Banff was accessible by automobile from Calgary.</p>
